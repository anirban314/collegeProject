## rsitm-web
Pre-deployment build of my first web-development project

This is the 'beta' version of the very first website I built a long time
back to learn about web-development. Although working on this project was
quite fun, I realised while developing this that web-designing is not my
cup of tea.
Maybe that explains why I cannot find the final version of this project
and am having to upload its 'beta' version, lest I lose this too.
